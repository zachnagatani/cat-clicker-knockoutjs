# Cat Clicker - Knockout.js

Cat Clicker - Knockout.js is a simple project app for Udacity's JavaScript Design Patterns course, built using Knockout.js to handle separation of concerns. (The focus was functionality and organized code... not visual design!)

## Usage

Head over to the <a href="http://zachnagatani.github.io/cat-clicker-knockoutjs/" target="_blank">live site</a>. Simpy click a cat's name in the list, and click away at the picture to increase your cat's click-counter and level!
